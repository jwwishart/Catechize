Catechize
=========

Catechize means to "examine through questioning and answering" and this web application is an attempt to create a re-usable framework from which someone could setup a question and answer style study website.

The program will allow multiple course each with multiple parts. Each part will have multiple pages. Each page will ask questions, show links to resources, provide information to the students etc.

The aim is for the application to be database driven and globalizable.
